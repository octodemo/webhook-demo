# Webhook receiver

An example of a quick and dirty webhook receiver for testing where you can't use
`ngrok`, ironically using `ngrok` to demonstrate it on a Mac.  Use port forwarding in Codespaces instead.

:warning: Not for production.  Contains out of date dependencies in `requirements.txt`.

## Real world

Change the `app.py` function to do something useful ... whatever it was that you were really wanting to accomplish.  Update the requirements in `requirements.txt` first.  Consider moving off Werkzeug.
